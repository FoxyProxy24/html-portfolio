<h1>The Best Movies According to Foxy</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Andromedia Strain</h3>
    <p>This is my ultimate favorite movie. I have been watching it since I was about 10-12 years old. I haven't stopped watching it since then. On average, I watch it about 10-20 times per year.</p>

<h3>Alien</h3>
    <p>This is another movie that I watch religiously. I try to watch it a dozen or more times per year.</p>

<h3>Aliens</h3>
    <p>Kind of the same thing as Alien but I watch it a little less. Still every year but maybe 5-10 times.</p>
